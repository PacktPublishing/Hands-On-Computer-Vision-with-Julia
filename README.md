This is the code repository for [Hands-On Computer Vision with Julia](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-computer-vision-julia?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788998796), published by Packt.

**Build complex applications with advanced Julia packages for image processing, neural networks, and Artificial Intelligence**

## What is this book about?
Hands-On Computer Vision with Julia is a thorough guide for developers who want to get started with building computer vision applications using Julia. Julia is well suited to image processing because itâ€™s easy to use and lets you write easy-to-compile and efficient machine code.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Analyze image metadata and identify critical data using JuliaImages
* Apply filters and improve image quality and color schemes
* Extract 2D features for image comparison using JuliaFeatures
* Cluster and classify images with KNN/SVM machine learning algorithms
* Recognize text in an image using the Tesseract library

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
 ```
 using Images
 sample_image_path = "sample-images/cats-3061372_640.jpg";
 sample_image = nothing
 if isfile(sample_image_path)
  sample_image = load(sample_image_path);
 else
  info("ERROR: Image not found!")
 end
```

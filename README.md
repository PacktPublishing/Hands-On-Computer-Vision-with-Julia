# Perl 6 Deep Dive
This is the code repository for [Perl 6 Deep Dive](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/perl-6-deep-dive?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787282049), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages consisting of Perl 5 and Perl 6. Perl 6 helps developers write concise and declarative code that is easy to maintain.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective code folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
my $a = 10;
my $b = 20;
my $c = 0;
$c = add($a, $b);
say $c; # 30

sub add($a, $b) {
  return $a + $b;
}
```

This book can, of course, be read without a computer at hand, in which case, you need nothing more than the book itself. However, to follow the examples in the book, you need a compiler of Perl 6, which you can download from http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/ (more details on installing it are in Chapter 1, What is Perl 6?). The Rakudo Perl 6 compiler works on a variety of platforms--Windows, macOS, and Linux. You will also need your favorite text editor to write programs in.
